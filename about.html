        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>
            Roger and Karen’s story began on the water. They met as members of the University of Arkansas Waterski Team, where they trained on Beaver Lake under incredible mentors who instilled in them not just skill, but a deep love for the sport. Waterskiing became more than a pastime—it became a lifelong passion. <br><br>
            After graduating, Roger and Karen married and started building their life together. They purchased land in Durham, Arkansas, where they built their home and, in 2000, dug their first lake. By then, they were raising their growing family, welcoming daughters Julianna, Lauren, Brooke, and Andrew. In 2007, they expanded their dream by digging a second lake, laying the foundation for what would become Cedar Creek Ski Park. <br><br>

            <br>From the very beginning, they knew they wanted to stay connected to the sport that shaped their lives—and more importantly, to share it with others. Their vision was to create a place where skiers of all levels could come together, improve their skills, and experience the joy of waterskiing in a supportive, family-centered environment.<br><br>
            In 2008, they hosted their first major tournament—South Central Regionals—and began running ski camps for athletes of all ages. What started as a personal love for the sport blossomed into a mission to grow the sport by welcoming others in, building community, and fostering new generations of skiers.<br><br>
            Today, Roger and Karen, with the help of their kids, continue to host tournaments, camps, and clinics, creating opportunities for beginners and seasoned athletes alike. At Cedar Creek Ski Park, every skier is family, and every set on the water is a chance to grow, push limits, and fall deeper in love with the sport.<br><br>
